An updated interface to Iasos's "Golden Harp".

Thanks to Don Miller (@no-carrier) for reverse engineering the serial 
interface to the harp controller and creating the first Arduino implementation
to validate the controller interface.

Original implementation was a Commodore 64 program by Richard Wolton whose 
source code is lost in the mists of time.
